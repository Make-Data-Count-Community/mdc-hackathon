## Viz-Wizards!

### Purpose
Making efficient visualisations for the data corpus.

### Visualization Tools

The visualization was created using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ross.gray/viz/MakeDataCountHackathonVisualisations/CitationsandLogCitationsbySubjectArea), which allowed for interactive and dynamic visual exploration of the dataset.

### How to Use This Visualization
Visit the [Tableau Public link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ross.gray/viz/MakeDataCountHackathonVisualisations/CitationsandLogCitationsbySubjectArea) to interact with the visualization.
Use filters and interactive elements to explore different aspects of the dataset.
The visualization is divided into multiple dashboards focusing on different questionsâ€”navigate through them to gain comprehensive insights.

### Key Findings

- The majority of dataset citations are concentrated in the biological sciences and basic medicine.
- Citations over time demonstrate that datasets were hardly cited in publications pre-2000 but this is likely due to technical limitations of the time. Since then there has been a sharp rise in dataset citations in papers, with the most prominant rise happening in the biological sciences.
- Splitting citation count by subject and journal/publisher we can see the dominance of the basic and biological sciences, with some journals being dominant in these areas but none completely standing out.
- Research from Europe and the US tends to receive a higher number of citations
- Examining the most cited datasets by subject area and repository, show that most datasets are from the biological sciences and basic medicine, with chemical and physical sciences also featuring. The most cited datasets are found in the European Nucleotide Archive which would make sense given these house important DNA and RNA information, heavily referenced by research.
