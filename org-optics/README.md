## Org Optics

### Goal
Provide user-friendly insights into dataset citations by institution.

### Overview
A website with profile pages for every organization with dataset citations, listing all datasets with citations, papers that cite dataset from the org, and summary statistic insights

### Why
- Organizations can see insights about where data from their institution is being cited
- Potential applicants can look at the type of impactful data coming out of universities
- Researchers can look at the impact of their data publications (once we add researcher pages)
